Challenge Problem 1

Hi! I'm Nae.

This code was built with primary HTML and CSS code from the first week or so of class and outside research using Google and Chat GPT for items I was confused upon.

## Semantics
To show the Header, Nav, Section, Aside, and Footer, update the semantic components.
Added a navigational identifier to the content section using the identifier id="search-engine-optimization"
The alt property was added to img (displays a description when the picture cannot be displayed).

Benefit-asside will replace the CSS selectors benefit-cost, benefit-lead, and benefit-brand.
Include a CSS class selector.formatting pictures for the aside section with benefit-aside img in CSS
Consolidate the CSS selectors for social media marketing, online reputation management, and search engine optimization into a single class named content-section. include a CSS class selector.Converting pictures for the aside section's content-section into CSS
added annotations to the HTML and CSS code to outline webpage parts
HTML components should be rearranged to suit a logical framework.
Rearrange heading qualities such that they fall in sequential order and adhere to logic
## Other things
Ensured some elements of the assignment had a custom feel to it akin to my own work.
